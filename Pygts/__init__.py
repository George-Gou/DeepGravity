Pygts: A Python Toolbox for gravity time series processing
Author: Jianing Gou(goujianing19@mails.ucas.ac.cn)
==================================================================

Pygts is an open-source project dedicated to provide a Python framework for
processing continuous gravity time series data(such as superconductivity gravimeter or PET/gPhone gravimeter).
It provides parsers for common file formats
and seismological signal processing routines which allow the manipulation of
seismological time series.

The goal of the ObsPy project is to facilitate rapid application development
for seismology.
